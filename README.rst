The Face Recognition Library
============================

Welcome to the Face Recognition Library.
This library is designed to perform a fair comparison of face recognition algorithms.
It contains scripts to execute various kinds of face recognition experiments on a variety of facial image databases, and running baseline algorithms is as easy as going to the command line and typing::

  $ bin/baselines.py --database frgc --algorithm lda


.. warning::
  The .git repository of the FaceRecLib has moved to another location.
  From now on, please use the repository located at https://github.com/idiap/facereclib or download the latest stable version from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/facereclib.
  Thank you for your understanding.
